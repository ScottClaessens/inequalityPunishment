    Introduction to Part 2 (Phase 2)

<p>
    Once the vote is completed, group members will make the same allocation decisions as in Phase 1 for 4 decision rounds.
    Your earnings from the private account and the group account in each decision round will be calculated in the same
    way as in Phase 1. However, now you will also pay the fine that your group voted on at the beginning of Phase 2.
</p>
<p>
    If the group ends up choosing a fine rate higher than zero, i.e. if the group ends up choosing a fine rate of 30%,
    60%, or 80%, then each member of the group will have to pay a fixed fee. This fee is equal to 4 tokens in each round if a
    fine greater than zero is chosen. This means that any time the group chooses a fine rate of 30%, 60%, or 80%, 4 tokens
    will be deducted from the earnings of each individual group member in each round. The fee is the same regardless of whether the
    fine rate is 30%, 60%, or 80%. There is no fee if the fine chosen is 0%. This fee is in addition to any loss of earnings
    due to the fine itself.
