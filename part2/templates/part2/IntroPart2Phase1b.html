    Introduction to Part 2 (Phase 1)
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

<p>
    There are 5 decision rounds in Phase 1.
</p>
<p>
    In each decision round in Part 2, all group members will simultaneously make an <b>allocation decision</b>.
</p>
<p>
    {% if treatment != "equality" %}
    Type A members each receive an endowment of 80 tokens in each round, and Type B members each receive an endowment of
    20 tokens in each round.
    {% else %}
    Group members each receive an endowment of 50 tokens in each round.
    {% endif %}
    The task of each group member is to allocate his/her endowment of tokens between his/her
    private account and the group account. Each token not allocated to the group account will be automatically allocated
    to members' private accounts. The total earnings of each group member include earnings both from their private account
    and the group account.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Earnings from your private account in each round:</b> You will earn one (1) token for each token allocated to your
    private account. No one else will earn from your private account.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Earnings from the group account in each round:</b> For each token you allocate to the group account, you will earn
    0.4 tokens. Each of the other two members of your group will also earn 0.4 tokens for each token you allocate to the
    group account. Thus, the allocation of 1 token to the group account yields a total of 1.6 tokens for your group. Your
    earnings from the group account are based on the total number of tokens allocated to the group account by all members
    in your group. Each member will profit equally from the tokens allocated to the group account - for each token allocated
    to the group account, each member of your group will earn 0.4 tokens regardless of who made the allocation. This means
    that you will earn from your own allocation to the group account, as well as from the allocations to the group account
    of your three group members.
</p>
<p>
    Tokens you do not allocate to the group account are automatically allocated to the private account.
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Your earnings from the decision round = (Your endowment - number of tokens allocated to the group account by you)
        + 0.4 x (total allocation to the group account by all four group members)
    </b>
