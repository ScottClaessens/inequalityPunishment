    Introduction to Part 2
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

<p>
    During Part 2, all decisions are made in tokens (more details below). Your total earnings will also be calculated
    in tokens and, at the end of the experiment will be converted to Pounds at the following rate:
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        110 tokens = Â£1.00
    </b>
</p>
{% if treatment != "equality" %}
    <p>
        There will be two types of members in each group - Type A and Type B. Of the four members of each group, two will
        be Type A and two will be Type B.
    </p>
{% endif %}
<p>
    There will be several decision rounds in Part 2. At the beginning of each round, each group member receives an
    endowment of tokens.
    {% if treatment != "equality" %}
    The difference between the two types of players is the endowment of tokens they receive.
    In particular, <b>Type A group members will receive an endowment of 80 tokens in each round, while Type B group
    members will receive an endowment of 20 tokens in each round.</b>
    {% else %}
    Group members will receive an endowment of 50 tokens in each round.
    {% endif %}
