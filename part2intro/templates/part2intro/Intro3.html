<p>
    In each round, before making allocation decisions, participants will also choose a <b>fine rate</b>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The fine rate applies to <b>any tokens <u>not</u> allocated to the group account</b>.</li>
    <li>All four members will vote for <b>one</b> of the following fine rates: <b>0%, 30%, 60%, or 80%</b>.</li>
    <li>The fine rate that receives the most votes will be implemented for that round, with ties broken randomly.</li>
    <li>If the implemented fine rate is 0%, there is no fine.</li>
    <li>If the implemented fine rate is 30%, 60%, or 80%, then each participant in your group will be fined for tokens that
    they do not allocate to the group account, plus an additional fixed fee of 4 tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><u>Example</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    The fine rate chosen by majority is 30%.
</p>
<p>
    You keep 10 tokens in your private account. You will be fined 30% of 10 tokens (3 tokens), and will additionally pay
    the fixed fee of 4 tokens.
